    "0.1": "-the ball's trail during Block Break will no longer appear until the ball has been launched\n-in Block Break, if the ball is launched while the platform is moving, it will now be launched at an angle\n-implemented the Gameblock OS, a new interface that lets you choose which game you want to play (in the future it'll also be used to join multiplayer games)\n-games now support text rendering\n-fixed the networking code not being thread-safe\n-fixed several syncing issues in Block Break\n-the particles when the Block Break ball explodes now spawn at a fixed height\n-changed the way colors are handled internally for more convenient coding\n-the particle effects in Block Break now twinkle\n-fixed games continuing to run in the background once closed\n-implemented music and sounds\n-reworked and rebalanced the block break game\n-added a new background effect to block break to make it look less bland\n-implemented a system for saving game data\n-added shortcuts for quickly restarting the games\n-added a scoring and high score system for each game\n-add a new game: Defusal\n-implemented update checker\n-added Modrinth link to the mod properties",
